% Write a MATLAB program to calculate the following expression and round the 
% answers to the nearest integer.  

% Q1. 

x1 = 2; % creating x1, and y1 variable as x,y.
y1 = 4;

z1 = round(sqrt(5*x1^2 + y1^2))

% Q2.

x2 =  pi/4;

z2 = round(4*cos(x2) + j*6*sin(x2))

% Q3.

x3 = pi/3;
y2 = 2;

z3 = round(3*sin(x3) + 4*cos(x3) + 3*exp(y2))

% Q4.

x = pi/2;
y = sin(x) / x;
